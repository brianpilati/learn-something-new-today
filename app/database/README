** Sync'ing **
There are two components - Live Site and Development. Please keep both dbs in sync by updating the "dbScripts" with the same changes as the "updates" folder.



** Updating the PRODUCTION SITE **
Build a script in the updates folder to run. These scripts should be one time use only.





** NEVER DO THIS ON THE PRODUCTION SITE **
Install everything for scratch

This preserves the information from the first database
and creates all the new tables
$ ./installDatabase.sh
